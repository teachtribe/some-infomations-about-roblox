    Some games ask players to spend Robux, which is in-game money. However, players buy Robux with real money, so users need to be careful about how much Robux they spend. When games raise Robux, Roblox splits the profit with the game maker. Some people have made millions through Robux spent in their games! But don’t worry, players don’t have to spend money to have fun on Roblox! Accounts are free, and features that cost Robux are optional.

    Anyone can make a Roblox account. That’s great because it means kids everywhere can have fun. Still, users should be careful about who they talk with. It’s fun to talk with friends online while playing a Roblox game. However, remember to never give personal information to strangers.
